Improve website performance (along with Google PageSpeed Insights scores) with compressed and optimized images and lazy loading - all while actually delivering a better user experience because the rollout of Core Web Vitals has proven one thing: performance is about far more than *just* scoring well on performance testing tools. Visitor experience matters.

### Local WebP - Serve Images In Next-Gen Formats

With Smush, you can take advantage of next-gen image formats by converting all of your images to WebP. WebP is a file format that enables superior image compression and quality retention. All major performance testing solutions, including Google PageSpeed Insights, assess your site's ability to serve images in these next-gen formats due to the significant impact on visitor experience.

**WebP lossless images are 26% smaller in size compared to PNGs. WebP lossy images are 25-34% smaller than comparable JPG images**. More information can be found in [this Google developers article](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp).

**The best part:** Smush's Local WebP feature makes this incredibly easy to set up with the ability to host all images locally (not requiring the use of a CDN). Our Local WebP feature includes automatically replacing PNG and JPEG images on your website's frontend to serve WebP images - with the necessary fallbacks for browsers that don't support WebP yet.

Note: Yes, Smush supports WebP conversion for all image formats, including JPEG to WebP and PNG to WebP.

With the best image optimization plugin for WordPress - you can finally stop worrying about the performance impact of using the images you want on your website. 

### Compress Images While Preserving Image Quality

Image compression plugins don't have to destroy images with a visible, 30% loss in quality. Smush strips hidden information from your images (that can often be bulky), and reduces image file sizes without introducing a visible impact on appearance. 

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZJGq4zwf1A]

Smush meticulously scans every image you upload - or have already added to your site - cuts all the unnecessary data, and scales it for you before adding it to your media library. And it can serve images in the WebP format.

### Compress Images While You Sleep With Background Image Optimization

Have a large number of images to compress? Smush’s powerful optimization features will continue to work their magic in the background, even when you’ve closed the plugin completely. You’ll receive an email when image optimization has been completed - with a full report.

### Compress Any Image in Any Directory

As well as smushing your media uploads, you may want to compress the images stored in other folders. Smush now lets you compress any image in any directory - so that you can optimize all the images on your site - including [NextGEN](https://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-gallery/) images, images stored on Amazon S3 using [WP Offload Media](https://wordpress.org/plugins/amazon-s3-and-cloudfront/) and images in EVERY WordPress plugin and theme package!

### Compatible with Your Favorite Themes, Page Builders, and Media Library Plugins

No matter what theme or plugins you use to manage your WordPress media library, Smush has you covered. Check out just a few of the popular products Smush is working with to help make your site faster and more efficient:

- [WP All Import](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-all-import/)
- [WP Offload Media](https://wordpress.org/plugins/amazon-s3-and-cloudfront/)
- [WP Media Folder](https://www.joomunited.com/wordpress-products/wp-media-folder)

### Incorrect Image Size Detection ###
Smush includes a wrong-size image finder. Activate this feature, and your images will be highlighted with smart tips to let you easily resize your images. Quickly locate the images that are keeping you from getting that perfect 100 on your Google PageSpeed test.

### Defer Offscreen Images (Lazy Load) ###
Smush includes built-in lazy loading. If your page has a bunch of images below the fold, lazy loading will drastically speed up your page by serving only the images being viewed, and delaying others further down the page.

### Save time with Smush Configs ###
Configs allow you to save your preferred Smush configuration settings and apply them to your other sites in a few clicks. You can create unlimited configs.

### Privacy

Smush does not interact with end users on your website. The only input option Smush has is to a newsletter subscription for site admins only.

Smush uses a third-party email service (Mailchimp) to send informational emails (opt-in) to the site administrator. The administrator's email address is sent to Mailchimp and a cookie is set by the service. Only administrator information is collected by Mailchimp.

Smush sends images to the WPMU DEV servers to optimize them for web use. This includes the transfer of EXIF data. The EXIF data will either be stripped or returned as it is. It is not stored on the WPMU DEV servers.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I just finished running Smush, but Google PageSpeed still says my images need compressing and resizing. How do I fix it? =

This means your images were not properly scaled for where they are being displayed. Scaling images before uploading them can be time-consuming, but can save space and speed up load time. First, determine what size your image needs to be. You can use the built-in images size detector included in the free version of Smush to find what height and width your image should be. Once you know how large the image should be, scale your images to the right size.

= PageSpeed Insights is telling me to defer offscreen images. Can Smush fix that?

Lazy Load will defer your offscreen images from loading until they are needed. From the Smush Dashboard, select Lazy Load and click Activate. Smush Lazy Load works out of the box or can be customized based on your needs.

*Tip:* If you're having any issues or want to save a ton of time, the Smush Pro CDN includes auto-resizing of images.

= Does Smush delete or replace my original full-size images? =

Nope. WordPress crops and resizes every image you upload for embedding on your site. By default, Smush only compresses these cropped and resized images, not your original full-size images. To compress your original full-sized images, use [Smush Pro](https://wpmudev.com/project/wp-smush-pro/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=smush-readme&utm_content=smush_pro#trial).

= What type of file should I use for my images (GIF, PNG, JPG)? =

GIF files are large and can’t be optimized much. They should only be used if the image is animated.


PNG is best for computer generated graphics (vectors, logos, fonts, etc.), images with few colors, or images with transparency.


JPG should be used for photography or images with a lot of color variation.

*Tip:* The Smush Pro CDN includes WebP compression - sharper images that are 25 to 30 percent smaller than JPEG and PNG files.

= I’m a photographer. Can I keep all my EXIF data? =

Yes! EXIF data stores camera settings, focal length, date, time, and location information in image files. EXIF data makes image files larger, but if you are a photographer you may want to preserve this information. We have included the option to preserve EXIF image data with Smush.

= I just ran Bulk Smush and some of my images didn't get compressed. Why would this happen? =

First, check to see if you're receiving any server errors. If your images seem to be processing correctly, check the file size of the images being skipped. Images over 5mb will not be processed by the free version of Smush. To compress images up to 256mb, get [Smush Pro](https://wpmudev.com/project/wp-smush-pro/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=smush-readme&utm_content=wp_smush_pro#trial).

= I activated Smush, but I don’t see any difference in image quality. How am I supposed to know if Smush is working? =

Great question! It is important to understand Smush is an image optimization tool that uses lossless image compression to save disk storage space and speed up your site. Smush squeezes data out from your image files that will save space, resize huge images, and improve speed - all without changing quality.

You can track file size changes in your media library, individual image savings, directory savings, and Smush total savings with Smush stats. If you want to see some additional magic, run before-and-after page-speed tests with Google PageSpeed Insights. Every little bit of resource savings is important when it comes to page-speed!

= Can't I just use Photoshop or another image editing application to optimize my images? =

Optimizing all the image sizes generated by WordPress, images being imported from plugins and themes, and images from other web sites is a painful and time-consuming process.

Smush automatically handles optimizing all your images no matter where they come from, and can be used either as a standalone tool or alongside Photoshop.

= My Google PageSpeed test is telling me to serve images in Next-Gen formats. Can Smush do that? =

WebP and other Next-Gen formats are not supported on all browsers and require fallback images. For that reason, WebP conversion is only available in Smush Pro. Smush Pro converts images to WebP for a 25-30% savings over JPEG and PNG, and serves fallback images on unsupported browsers.

= Is it optimize or optimise? =
It depends what side of the pond you live on... but whether you say optimize, optimise, optimizer, or Smush goddess of speed, this plugin will make sure your images are loading lightning fast.

= How can I report security issues or bugs? =

We take plugin security incredibly seriously; if you have a bug or vulnerability to report, you can do so through the Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program. It’s fast, easy, and you will be notified when the issue is fixed. [Report a vulnerability](https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/wp-smushit).
